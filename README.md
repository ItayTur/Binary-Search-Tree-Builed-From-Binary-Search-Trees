# Binary-Search-Tree-Builed-From-Binary-Search-Trees
The app implements a binary search tree that each of its nodes contains a binary search tree.
The story is a boxes-storage application. Each box has its own UpdateTime, height and quantity(the deep tree). To each height theres a width(the high tree). The user can see all the boxes and their data in the storage, add, sell, and see the last actions made on each box.
Also boxes that are not being touched and their update time is longer then the app premits get deleted.
